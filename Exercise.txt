1. Explain what the terminal is in your own words. Terminal is a program 
in a computer that allows commands to be inserted to achive an outcome, 
for example I had to create a directory or folder with commands through 
the terminal and secondly I had to go in again and insert a code command to 
achieve making a text file which is this same one I am editing on which in 
fact did need a command "nano "name of file" to allow editing to happen.

 2. What is the major difference between Git and Github? Git is a local 
VCS software that enables developers to save snapshots of their projects 
over time. It’s generally best for individual use.
 
GitHub is a web-based platform that incorporates git’s version control 
features so they can be used collaboratively. It’s a platform that can hold 
repositories of code in cloud-based storage so that multiple developers 
can work on a single project and see each others’ edits in real-time.


 3. Why do we use Github? We use Github so we can publish our work in our 
own repository which we can go in and view and pull which is very easy to 
access and allows a safe palce for our work to be accessed.
